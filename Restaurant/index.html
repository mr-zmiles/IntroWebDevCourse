               It all started almost 100 hundred years ago in a small town in Italy when Papa Tony was in his early 20’s.
               Since he was a young boy, he always loved cooking for friends and family, so he decided to open a small a
               restaurant. Little did he know that this restaurant would turn out to be massive success and lead to him
               opening several other restaurants in other small villages across the Italian countryside. Unfortunately,
               as life would have it, Papa Tony fell ill and passed away, but before he was gone, he trained Little Papa
               Tony on running the restaurant with the same passion he had. Little Papa Tony had the opportunity to travel
               to America, so in 1945 he sold his restaurant chain and moved to East Texas. He worked for several years in
               restaurants in the East Texas area, and in 1965 he opened up Tony’s Good Eats in Tyler, TX. Since 1965 Tony’s
               Good eats has been a staple in Tyler serving everything from traditional Italian food to American favorites.
               Tony's Good Eats prides itself on using fresh local ingredients. We ensure that all meat is of the highest quality, and we are
               as close to farm to table as possible. Our mission is a simple one: Serve delicious and local food in a family
               atmosphere that our guests will want to return to week after week. We are proud of our Italian
               heritage and want you to come enjoy a meal with us!
